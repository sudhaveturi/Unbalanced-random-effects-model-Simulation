# Unbalanced-random-effects-model-Simulation

This is an exercise to examine the influence of unbalancedness on parameter estimation (bias), hypothesis testing (type 1 errors and power under $H0: \sigma^2_a = 0 vs. H1: \sigma^2_a Ì¸=0 $$, and prediction (shrinkage in the BLUP) using a simple one-way random effects model, under varying levels of overall sample sizes, numbers of groups, and between-unit variances.
