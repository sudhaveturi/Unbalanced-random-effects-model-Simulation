# Unbalanced-random-effects-model-Simulation

This is an exercise to examine the influence of unbalancedness on parameter estimation (bias), hypothesis testing (type 1 errors and power), and prediction (shrinkage in the BLUP) using a simple one-way random effects model, under varying levels of overall sample sizes, numbers of groups, and between-unit variances. Further details of the simulation and corresponding results can be found [here](https://github.com/sudhaveturi/Unbalanced-random-effects-model-Simulation/blob/master/Paper_BST760_SV_ED.pdf)
